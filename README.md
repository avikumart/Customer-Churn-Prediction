## Customer Churn Prediction - Research Project


### Executive summary

With an increasing demand for Direct-to-Home (DTH) connections across the rural and urban parts of the country, the market has experienced increasing competition to acquire new customers by providing lucrative offers to DTH customers. To survive in the market the company wants to acquire new customers while retaining existing customers which helps to increase the lifetime revenue of the user. To increase customer retention and reduce churn we want to analyze customer data and purchase history to identify the most probable churners through Exploratory data analysis, Churn modeling, and Evaluation of such models. Customer churn modeling helps t
o identify a segment of customers who are most likely to churn so that businesses can offer customizable pricing and personalized offers to such users leading to reduced churn and increased retention, We use Machine learning modeling techniques such as Logistics regression, Random Forest, Gradient boosting, and K-Nearest neighbors to model the prediction model and do comparative analysis to identify most accurate model. We aim to provide specific business recommendations for the revenue and marketing teams for personalized marketing campaigns targeting potential churners so that the revenue of the company can be increased while mitigating risk for the business. We also aim to analyze data using data pre-processing, univariate, and bivariate analysis to further understand customer preferences and behaviors that drive customer churn.

### Objectives of research

1. To describe the dataset and generate a data report for further analysis.
2. To perform data pre-processing and data cleaning of customer churn dataset.
3. To analyze data using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization techniques for business insights generation to identify most likely churners for the business.
4. To develop Machine learning models for customer churn prediction for future values for the business that identify and segment potential churners for the business.
5. To evaluate, tune, and interpret machine learning models for explainability for the business stakeholders
6. To generate business recommendations from churn prediction modeling to optimize marketing campaigns and reduce customer churn.

### Research Methodology

1. Data description and data report: 
Methods such as a data description, metadata, and data summarization to prepare a comprehensive data report
2. Data cleaning methods:
Data cleaning methods and techniques include missing value treatment, outlier detection, and removal, and data quality checks among others.
3. Exploratory data analysis and Data visualization:
We will perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate data analysis to derive insights and recommendations  for DTH business to reduce customer churn
4. Data pre-processing techniques:
Data pre-processing techniques such as data standardization, data normalization, and data encoding would be used to pre-process data for machine learning modeling.  
5. Machine learning modeling:
Machine learning modeling techniques such as Logistics regression, Random Forest, Gradient boosting, and K-nearest neighbors would be used for customer churn modeling.
6. Model evaluation, tuning, and interpretation:
Machine learning modeling evaluation metrics such as an accuracy score, precision, recall, and confusion matrix would be used. Moreover, model tuning and interpretation techniques like feature importance, and hyperparameter tuning would be used.
7. Business recommendations:
Finally, we will derive insights and business recommendations from our modeling to develop personalized marketing campaigns for the businesses.
